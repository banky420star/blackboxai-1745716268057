# Advanced LSTM & DRL Trading Bot

## Project Overview
The Advanced LSTM & DRL Trading Bot is a sophisticated trading application that utilizes Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) and advanced technical analysis to automate trading strategies in financial markets. This bot integrates various functions such as sentiment analysis of financial news using FinBERT, technical indicators, a trading environment, and risk management capabilities, making it a comprehensive tool for both automated and manual trading.

## Installation
To install the trading bot, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-trading-bot-repo.git /opt/trading_bot
   cd /opt/trading_bot
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment**:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   Ensure you have `requirements.txt` in your project directory and run:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Configure API Keys**:
   Store your API keys securely using environment variables or a `.env` file. You can refer to the [Usage Guide](USAGE_GUIDE.md) for examples.

## Usage
To run the trading bot:

1. Start the bot with:
   ```bash
   python3 src/main.py
   ```

2. Monitor the real-time status and metrics by opening the bot's dashboard:
   ```bash
   python3 -m http.server 8000
   ```
   Access the dashboard at `http://your_vm_public_ip:8000`.

You can also run tests to verify all components by executing:
```bash
python3 test_bot.py
```

## Features
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Analyzes financial news using the FinBERT model to predict market sentiment.
- **Technical Indicators**: Implements various technical indicators to analyze price trends.
- **Risk Management**: Calculates position size and manages risks based on user-defined configurations.
- **Trading Environment**: Simulates a trading environment for training and testing the trading model.
- **Extensible Architecture**: Easily add or modify components to customize trading strategies.

## Dependencies
The bot relies on several Python packages. The following dependencies are specified in `requirements.txt`:
- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `loguru`
- `transformers`
- `torch`
- `beautifulsoup4`
- `requests`

Make sure these packages are installed as part of the installation process.
